Aurafit
AuraFit is a next-generation web application designed to combat workout
inconsistency and lack of motivation by transforming fitness into an immersive,
gamified experience. The project leverages a conversational AI, powered by Google's
Gemini model and voiced by ElevenLabs' realistic text-to-speech, to act as a personal
fitness coach. The system's core innovation lies in its unique user interface, inspired
by the popular manhwa Solo Leveling, which presents the user's fitness journey as a
real-life Role-Playing Game (RPG). Users are onboarded through a voice-first
conversation, receive dynamically generated workout plans, track their progress
through RPG-like stats (Strength, Endurance), and "level up" by completing quests
and workouts, creating a powerful and engaging feedback loop to foster long-term
commitment.
